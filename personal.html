          <!-- Coding -->
          <p>I'm a web developer and designer with a mission to break into the tech industry.
          I began my journey into programming like most millenials:
          playing with HTML on MySpace. I found a love for web design back then, and seeing
          what kinds of visual changes I could implement. Little did I know that I was 'coding'
          even then! Since then, I've helped develop web and mobile aplications, began some side projects,
          and devoted myself to understanding software architecture and design patterns.<br>

          <!-- Design -->
          <p>I've always had a natural eye for design, and I'm always looking for new ways to
          channel that energy into something tangible. I've been creating logos and posters independently
          for about 5 years, which began as necessity; I needed to get things done, and I didn't want to have to depend
          on outsourcing to accomplish them. I also have experienced as a photographer, editor, and model.
          Recently, I've been creating wireframes and prototypes to incorporate my
          love of design and technical knowledge. <br>

          <!-- Music -->
          <p>My lifelong passion has always been music. Since the age of 8, I've been holding some sort
          of instrument, or wielding the power of the pen as a composer. My Bachelor's degree is in Music with
          a focus on Black American Music. My thesis is called "A Sound Experiment: Hip Hop as the Jazz Legacy", and focused on
          the shared connections between musicians of the Diaspora, as well as comparing musical idioms in these genres to 
          their Western, classical counterparts. This also influenced the creation of my art collective,
          the <a href="https://robinblakesoundexperiment.com/">Robin Blake Sound Experiment</a>. We've been blessed enough to not only get to 
          play all over Cleveland, but to share our music across the state and East Coast.<br>

          <!-- Creation -->
          <p>Something I'm the most proud of is my art festival, <a href="https://robindeanblake.com/Creation//">Creation</a>. I started this event on
          a whim back in 2018, and haven't looked back since. I've successfully organized, promoted, and hosted
          four iterations of this festival, with a fifth on the way! We've managed to raise over $6,000 for local
          organizations that support underserved communities. I'm so grateful to be able to provide this 
          opportunity for people to gather in a safe space free of judgement, where free expression is encouraged.
